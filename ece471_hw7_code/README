ECE471 Fall 2020 -- HW7

Name:

4. Describe your something cool:
	Alerts the user if the temperature is freezing cold, or quite literally boiling hot.


5. a. Hard real-time, the brakes are critical to safety, and if they do not stop in that time there may be total failure of system.
   b. This is a soft real-time task, results are still useful, just annoys the user to wait slightly longer
   c. This is a firm real-time task. IF a frame is not ready when needed, it is of no use, the very definition of a firm task.
   d. SPI uses more pins, and also has a shorter distance for wires.
   e. Power consumption; SPI is more energy efficient
   f. This would not work for SPI is not effective past about 10 feet or so, due to the capacitance of the wires increasing with length.
   g. Userspace can not assure real time, so it just may ruin that bitbanging enjoyment.

6. a. Treat it like a fireplace, anything that goes in is "incinerated" and removed 
   b. One could say it is the arch nemesis of null, for everything is full, and reports a write error 
   c. Perhaps removing personal data, like a paper shredder of sorts for files
   d. Possibly some random
