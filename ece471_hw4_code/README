ECE 471 Fall 2020 -- Homework 4

Name:


Briefly describe what you did for something cool (if applicable):
	Something cool is inside of read_switch.c, and toggles the LED based on the state of the switch. Switch is debounced using sampling rather than sleeping.

Answers to Question #5:

a. While a busy loop taxes the CPU, the usleep() function puts minimal strain on the processor and allows for other taks to be completed

b. The operating system handles talking directly to the hardware; userspace code communicates with a part of the operating system known as the Kernel, which is similar to an interpreter in an interpretive programming language (to an extent). The Kernel has modules/drivers that interpret code, and in turn perform the actions requested by the userspace code. 

c. The debouncing of the switch was done using sampling. I thought about using sleep and "polling" values, but I felt as though using sampling is slightly faster and leaves room for other instructions and functions to be implemented.

Answers to Question #6:

a. Machine type: Machine Model: Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Rev 1.1

b. Kernel version: 5.4.5l-v7l+

c. Free Disk space: 14GB

d. Prints the results of df in human-readable format, found using df --help
